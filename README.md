# Vacuum_ATM
Automatically reward the first person who vacuums the floor.

This is a project that tracks the dust levels in your house and tells you when to vacuum. A Photon 2 microcontroller detects when the vacuum is removed/replaced. Meanwhile a separate Photon 2 mounted inside a toy vending machine tracks if you have vacuumed for long enough to get a reward. If you have vacuumed long enough, you can turn the crank and get a plastic capsule filled with whatever (money, candy, etc).

## Directory

**Vacuum_ATM** - This folder contains the code for the dispensing side of the system.

**Vacuum_Status** - This folder contains the code for the photon that senses the presence of the vacuum.

**3D_Models** - Models to print out to get everything to work.

**Cut_Files** - Files to cut on a CNC router or laser cutter.

**Wiring Diagram** - Images of the wiring of both the Vacuum ATM and the Vacuum Status Photons.

**Testing** - Where I did all of my initial R&D. Actually I'm kind of embarassed that you would even want to look in here. Go back up to 3D_models. This is not a good look for you.
